<summary>About the design:</summary>
<p>The theme I was going for is one of the wonder and endless expanse of the starry night sky. Before I started I had envisioned thousands of twinkling stars and wanted to create a game involving them in the gameplay.
<br />
The mechanics began as an idea for controlling a ship through the sky and avoiding the objects, like many top down 2d games. However as I began coding I decided to try limiting the control by having the ship only be able to grapple to stars for it's movement. I ended up spending a lot of time creating the visuals using p5 shapes for a more minimal and primal feel. <br /> I decided to use a website called beepbox to create the sounds since it was very good at making 8bit sounds. I was particularly pleased with the soundtrack and visual change in ambience that plays when you hit a shooting star, it was very rewarding to see my friends reactions when they first discovered that mechanic. <br /> The second mode of the game is one used in many racing games, where the standard gameplay is intensified by a time limit. I worked with this by adding a faster soundtrack with a more red colour palette, since red is often associated with danger.</p>

<p>I am a UWE Digital Media student coming to the end of my first year. I've found Creative Coding with p5.js to quickly become one of my favourite modules since I can apply my coding knowledge in a much more creative and artistic way.
